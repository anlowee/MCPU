Please don't **copy** directly!(I'm afraid my teacher will have trouble with me!)<br>
Due to ðŸ‘†, I add micro signature into my code, which you guys will never find out.<br>
But anyway, welcome all you guys exchange your discussion about design thought or code with me, that's why I make this repo public!<br>
Please don't **copy** directly!(again)<br>
